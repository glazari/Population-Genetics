# Population-Genetics

Codes for analysing how populations evolve over time. And how genes distribution changes over time as well.

For now the currently implemented analysis are:
  1. Common Ancestors

Future ideas for analysis:
  1. Last names evolutions.
  2. Natural selection of genes.
  3. Males and females in evolution.
